### **How to Play:**

The controls in [Wacky Flip](https://wackyflip.com/) are simple but require skill to master.

* **Tap to Jump**: Begin your flip by launching your character into the air.
* **Hold to Flip**: The longer you hold, the faster you rotate.
* **Release to Land**: Let go at just the right moment to land smoothlyâ€”on your feet for maximum points!

Timing, angle, and rotation are everything. Perfect landings will earn you high scores, while awkward crashes will have you laughingâ€”but restarting.

### **Tips and Tricks:**

- **Aim for the Target Zone** â€“ Many levels have bullseye-style landing spots. Hitting the center earns bonus points.
- **Unlock Characters** â€“ Completing challenges lets you unlock new characters with cool outfits and animations.
